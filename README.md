# Web3 Diagram

## **This is a cargo utility that allows developers to generate visualizations depicting data flows within their NEAR Rust smart contracts.**

<br>

### Which problem does it solve?
**Provides the ability to generate representations of methods to allow for anyone to quickly understand how the contract works.**

<br>

### Who can use this?
**Smart contract developers use it to generate the images, but the images can help anyone trying to understand whatâ€™s going on.**

<br>

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |

| Events | Functions that falls into near event [standard]([https://link](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/blob/master/near-contract-standards/src/event.rs)) |
| View Trait Impl | View only functions but trait implamentation |
| Mutation Trait Impl | Mutable functions but trait implamentation |
| Payable | Functions that except Near |
| Initializers | Smart contract initializer functions |
